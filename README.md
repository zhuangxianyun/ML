# Execution and Reproduction Guide for Cinema Rating Prediction Project

## Introduction
This guide outlines the steps to execute and reproduce results from the "machine-learning-cinema" Jupyter Notebook which involves movie rating predictions using various data science and machine learning techniques.

## Prerequisites
- Python (version 3.7 or newer)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab or Google Colab or VScode with Jupyter Extension
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib,seaborn (Ensure these are installed using `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn`)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment
1. Ensure Python and Jupyter Notebook are installed on your computer.
2. Open your command line interface (CLI) and install the required Python libraries if they are not already installed:


### Step 2: Download the Notebook and Data
1. Download the "machine-learning-cinema2.ipynb" and associated datasets"tmdb_5000_movies.csv". Place them in a directory accessible to your Jupyter environment.

### Step 3: Start Jupyter Notebook
1. Navigate to the directory containing the notebook and datasets using your CLI:

2. Start the Jupyter Notebook server:


### Step 4: Open the Notebook
1. Your web browser should open automatically with the Jupyter interface. If not, open your browser and go to http://localhost:8888.
2. Click on the "machine-learning-cinema2.ipynb" file to open it.

### Step 5: Run the Notebook
1. Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially:
- Click on a cell to select it.
- Press `Shift + Enter` or click on the "Run" button in the toolbar to execute the cell and move to the next one.
2. Ensure each cell completes before moving to the next (watch for the cell indicator to turn from `[*]` to a number).
3.There are 3 main parts of my code. You can run it with our report.
- pre-processing
- data visualization
- predictive modelling(linear regression with and without regularization,SVMs, MLPs with different architectures, random forests)


### Step 6: Review Results
1. As the cells execute, outputs including figures, metrics, and logs will display below each cell.
2. Review these outputs to verify the computations and results.

## Troubleshooting
- If a cell produces an error, check the error message for clues on what went wrong.
- Ensure all data files are in the correct location as specified in the notebook.
- Verify that all library versions are compatible with the notebook's code.
- Please be patient because of the substantial waiting time due to model training.
